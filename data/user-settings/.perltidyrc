# RECOMMENDED
# Format by PBP (Perl Best Practices book)
--perl-best-practices

# RECOMMENDED
# Do not send the result to standard output (otherwise it will be impossible to run perltidy with a list of files, for example in tests)
# pbp itself defines --standard-output, we reset it
--nostandard-output

# RECOMMENDED
# Do the final result right away (restarting won't change anything).
# With this option, formatting will be slower, but it will not be so that after
# the first formatting run, the second run will make changes.
--converge

# RECOMMENDED
# Margins for qw lists are better visible. It is recommended to include in the documentation from perltidy (see the section for pbp).
# It is not included in pbp only because it appeared later than the publication of pbp parameters
--extended-continuation-indentation

# RECOMMENDED
# The default length is 80, in pbp 78. This is from the days of small screens. Now it is written in the perltidy documentation
# that many people make a limit of 120 characters. I think this is reasonable and I will also do 120
